{"summary": "The BARRA:CuRDa dataset processing workflow starts with the curation of 17 handpicked RNA-seq datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). These datasets undergo quality control using FastQC, followed by trimming with Trimmomatic to remove low-quality bases and artifacts. The datasets are then subject to a secondary quality control phase to ensure the removal of ribosomal RNA and assess the transcript level abundance. Alignment and transcript quantification are done using STAR against the Homo sapiens reference genome from Ensembl (version GRCh38.94). The transcript-level abundance data are summarized into gene-level abundance estimates using the tximport package and DESeq2. This is followed by matrix transformation through the variance stabilizing transformation function of DESeq2 to prepare the final datasets suitable for downstream machine learning applications.", "tools": ["GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)", "FastQC", "Trimmomatic", "STAR", "Ensembl reference genome", "tximport", "DESeq2"], "techniques": ["Quality control", "Trimming of low-quality bases", "Removal of ribosomal RNA", "Alignment and transcript quantification", "Summarization of transcript-level abundance into gene-level abundance", "Matrix transformation via variance stabilizing transformation"]}
